the release L</name>. See L</ElasticSearchX::Model::Util::digest>.

=head2 name

=head2 name.analyzed

Name of the release (e.g. C<Some-Module-1.12>).

=head2 distribution

=head2 distribution.analyzed

=head2 distribution.camelcase

Name of the distribution (e.g. C<Some-Module>).

=head2 author

PAUSE ID of the author.

=head2 archive

Name of the tarball (e.g. C<Some-Module-1.12.tar.gz>).

=head2 date

B<Required>

=head2 version_numified

Numified version of L</version>. Contains 0 if there is no version or the
